<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a nutritious, delicious, creamy soup that is easy to make. We make this recipe usually 1-2 times per week as an easy way to get our vegetables in! As time goes on preparing it usually takes us no time at all.</p>
<p>To make this deilicious recipe, all you need are vegetables that you can find in any market, 5-10 minutes for prepping and an appetite.</p>
<h2>Ingredient list</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 big white onion</li>
    <li>5 sticks of celery </li>
    <li>5-6 carrots (depending on size)</li>
    <li>1 lbs (around 500 g) potatoes </li>
    <li>3-4 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>3 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tsp thyme (fresh or dried)</li>
    <li>salt and pepper</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>3 cups water or stock</li>
    <li>1/2 cup greek yogurt</li>
    <li>optional: turmeric, red pepper flakes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Insructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Roughly chop all the vegetables. I usually chop them in big chunks(around 1/2 inch) to minimize prepping time, but chop them small enough so you can blend them later on.</li>
<li>On medium-high heat add just enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pot. After it heats up add the onion, carrots and the celery. Cook them around 4-5 minutes or untill the onion starts to sweat.</li>
<li>Add the potatoes and the garlic and keep cooking for 1-2 minutes. Then add bay leaves and thyme.</li>
<li>Pour the water or the stock in, just enough to cover the vegetables. Add salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower to simmer and cook untill you can easily pierce the vegetables with a fork, about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>When the vegetables are softened, remove the pot from the heat. Remove the bay leaves and the thyme sping if using fresh thyme.</li>
<li>Puree the soup until smooth with a hand blender or a normal blender.</li>
<li>Stir in the yogurt. Add salt and pepper if needed. </li>
</ol>
